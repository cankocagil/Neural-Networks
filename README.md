# Neural-Networks

These repo contains my implementations to the Bilkent University EEE443/543 Neural Networks assignments. There are 3 mini projects followed by final project. The content of assignments are provided below. In general, these projects focus on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. In the mini projects, analytical derivations of neural network architectures including fully connected layers, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU) are done with corresponding Python implementations mainly using NumPy. In the final project, vision & language models are builted with the state of the art neural network architectures for image captioning task using PyTorch.
